# traction vector and stress tensor


## traction

![traction vector illustration](../images/traction.PNG)


## traction

-   The traction vector is defined as

\\[\hat{t}^n(x,\hat{n}) = \lim\limits_{\Delta A \to 0} \frac{\Delta \hat{f}}{\Delta A}\\]

-   By Newtonâ€™s third law (action-reaction principle)

\\[\hat{t}^n(x,\hat{n}) = -\hat{t}^n(x,-\hat{n})\\]


## traction

## traction

-   If we consider the special case where the normal vectors, $\hat{n}$, align with the coordinate system ($\hat{e}_1$,$\hat{e}_2$,$\hat{e}_3$)

-   On the 1-face:

\\[\begin{aligned}
	\hat{n}&=\hat{e}_1: &\quad \hat{t}^n = t_i^{(\hat{e}_1)} \hat{e}_i = t_1^{(\hat{e}_1)} \hat{e}_1 + t_2^{(\hat{e}_1)} \hat{e}_2 + t_3^{(\hat{e}_1)} \hat{e}_3
\end{aligned}\\]

-   On the 2-face:

\\[\begin{aligned}
	\hat{n}&=\hat{e}_2: &\quad \hat{t}^n = t_i^{(\hat{e}_2)} \hat{e}_i = t_1^{(\hat{e}_2)} \hat{e}_1 + t_2^{(\hat{e}_2)} \hat{e}_2 + t_3^{(\hat{e}_2)} \hat{e}_3
\end{aligned}\\]


## traction

-   And on the 3-face:

\\[\begin{aligned}
	\hat{n}&=\hat{e}_3: &\quad \hat{t}^n = t_i^{(\hat{e}_3)} \hat{e}_i = t_1^{(\hat{e}_3)} \hat{e}_1 + t_2^{(\hat{e}_3)} \hat{e}_2 + t_3^{(\hat{e}_3)} \hat{e}_3
\end{aligned}\\]


## stress tensor

-   To simplify the notation, we introduce the stress tensor

\\[\sigma_{ij} = t_j^{(\hat{e}_i)}\\]

## traction

-   We can find some interesting information about the traction vector by considering an arbitrary tetrahedron with some traction \\(\hat{t}^{(n)}\\) applied to the surface


## traction

-   If we consider the balance of forces in the \\(x_1\\)-direction

\\[t_1 dA - \sigma_{11}dA_1 - \sigma_{21}dA_2 - \sigma_{31}dA_3 + b_1 \rho dV = 0\\]

-   The area components are:

\\[\begin{aligned}
	dA_1 &= n_1 dA\\
	dA_2 &= n_2 dA\\
	dA_3 &= n_3 dA\\
\end{aligned}\\]

-   And \\(dV = \frac{1}{3}h dA\\).


## traction

\\[t_1 dA - \sigma_{11} n_1 dA - \sigma_{21} n_2 dA - \sigma_{31} n_3 dA + b_1 \rho \frac{1}{3}h dA = 0\\]

-   If we let \\(h \to 0\\) and divide by \\(dA\\)

\\[t_1 = \sigma_{11}n_1 + \sigma_{21}n_2 + \sigma_{31}n_3\\]

-   We can write this in index notation as

\\[t_1 = \sigma_{i1}n_i\\]


## traction

-   We find, similarly

\\[\begin{aligned}
	t_2 &= \sigma_{i2} n_i\\
	t_3 &= \sigma_{i3} n_i\\
\end{aligned}\\]


## traction

-   We can further combine these results in index notation as

\\[t_j = \sigma_{ij}n_i\\]

-   This means with knowledge of the nine components of \\(\sigma_{ij}\\), we can find the traction vector at any point on any surface


## example

-   Consider a block of material with a uniformly distributed force acting on the 1-face. Find the tractions on an arbitrary interior plane

![traction cut on some arbitrary plane](../images/traction-cut.png)


## example

-   First we consider a vertical cut on the interior 1-face (\\(n_i = \langle 1, 0, 0 \rangle\\))
-   Next we represent the force *P* as a vector, \\(p_i = \langle P, 0, 0 \rangle\\)
-   Balancing forces yields

\\(t_i A - p_i = 0\\)

-   We find \\(t_1 = \frac{P}{A} = \sigma_{11}\\), \\(t_2 = 0 = \sigma_{12}\\) and \\(t_3 = 0 = \sigma_{13}\\)


## example

-   No force is applied in the other directions, so it is trivial to find the rest of the stress tensor

\\[\sigma_{ij} = \begin{bmatrix}
	P/A & 0 & 0\\
	0 & 0 & 0\\
	0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}\\]


## example

-   We can now consider any arbitrary angle of interior cut.
-   The normal for a cut as shown in the diagram will be \\(n_i = \langle cos \theta, \sin \theta, 0 \rangle\\).
-   We can again use \\(t_j = \sigma_{ij}n_i\\) to find \\(t_j\\) for any angle

\\[\begin{aligned}
	t_1 &= \frac{P}{A} \cos \theta \\
	t_2 &= 0\\
	t_3 &= 0
\end{aligned}\\]
